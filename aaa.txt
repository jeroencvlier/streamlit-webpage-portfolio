Construct a new Layout object

Parameters
arg – dict of properties compatible with this constructor or an instance of plotly.graph_objects.Layout

activeselection – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Activeselection instance or dict with compatible properties

activeshape – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Activeshape instance or dict with compatible properties

annotations – A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout.Annotation instances or dicts with compatible properties

annotationdefaults – When used in a template (as layout.template.layout.annotationdefaults), sets the default property values to use for elements of layout.annotations

autosize – Determines whether or not a layout width or height that has been left undefined by the user is initialized on each relayout. Note that, regardless of this attribute, an undefined layout width or height is always initialized on the first call to plot.

autotypenumbers – Using “strict” a numeric string in trace data is not converted to a number. Using convert types a numeric string in trace data may be treated as a number during automatic axis type detection. This is the default value; however it could be overridden for individual axes.

bargap – Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of adjacent location coordinates.

bargroupgap – Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the same location coordinate.

barmode – Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are displayed on the graph. With “stack”, the bars are stacked on top of one another With “relative”, the bars are stacked on top of one another, with negative values below the axis, positive values above With “group”, the bars are plotted next to one another centered around the shared location. With “overlay”, the bars are plotted over one another, you might need to reduce “opacity” to see multiple bars.

barnorm – Sets the normalization for bar traces on the graph. With “fraction”, the value of each bar is divided by the sum of all values at that location coordinate. “percent” is the same but multiplied by 100 to show percentages.

boxgap – Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces that have “width” set.

boxgroupgap – Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of the same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that have “width” set.

boxmode – Determines how boxes at the same location coordinate are displayed on the graph. If “group”, the boxes are plotted next to one another centered around the shared location. If “overlay”, the boxes are plotted over one another, you might need to set “opacity” to see them multiple boxes. Has no effect on traces that have “width” set.

calendar – Sets the default calendar system to use for interpreting and displaying dates throughout the plot.

clickmode – Determines the mode of single click interactions. “event” is the default value and emits the plotly_click event. In addition this mode emits the plotly_selected event in drag modes “lasso” and “select”, but with no event data attached (kept for compatibility reasons). The “select” flag enables selecting single data points via click. This mode also supports persistent selections, meaning that pressing Shift while clicking, adds to / subtracts from an existing selection. “select” with hovermode: “x” can be confusing, consider explicitly setting hovermode: “closest” when using this feature. Selection events are sent accordingly as long as “event” flag is set as well. When the “event” flag is missing, plotly_click and plotly_selected events are not fired.

coloraxis – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Coloraxis instance or dict with compatible properties

colorscale – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Colorscale instance or dict with compatible properties

colorway – Sets the default trace colors.

computed – Placeholder for exporting automargin-impacting values namely margin.t, margin.b, margin.l and margin.r in “full-json” mode.

datarevision – If provided, a changed value tells Plotly.react that one or more data arrays has changed. This way you can modify arrays in-place rather than making a complete new copy for an incremental change. If NOT provided, Plotly.react assumes that data arrays are being treated as immutable, thus any data array with a different identity from its predecessor contains new data.

dragmode – Determines the mode of drag interactions. “select” and “lasso” apply only to scatter traces with markers or text. “orbit” and “turntable” apply only to 3D scenes.

editrevision – Controls persistence of user-driven changes in editable: true configuration, other than trace names and axis titles. Defaults to layout.uirevision.

extendfunnelareacolors – If true, the funnelarea slice colors (whether given by funnelareacolorway or inherited from colorway) will be extended to three times its original length by first repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20% darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing the same color when you have many slices, but you can set false to disable. Colors provided in the trace, using marker.colors, are never extended.

extendiciclecolors – If true, the icicle slice colors (whether given by iciclecolorway or inherited from colorway) will be extended to three times its original length by first repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20% darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing the same color when you have many slices, but you can set false to disable. Colors provided in the trace, using marker.colors, are never extended.

extendpiecolors – If true, the pie slice colors (whether given by piecolorway or inherited from colorway) will be extended to three times its original length by first repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20% darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing the same color when you have many slices, but you can set false to disable. Colors provided in the trace, using marker.colors, are never extended.

extendsunburstcolors – If true, the sunburst slice colors (whether given by sunburstcolorway or inherited from colorway) will be extended to three times its original length by first repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20% darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing the same color when you have many slices, but you can set false to disable. Colors provided in the trace, using marker.colors, are never extended.

extendtreemapcolors – If true, the treemap slice colors (whether given by treemapcolorway or inherited from colorway) will be extended to three times its original length by first repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20% darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing the same color when you have many slices, but you can set false to disable. Colors provided in the trace, using marker.colors, are never extended.

font – Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in traces and other layout components inherit from the global font.

funnelareacolorway – Sets the default funnelarea slice colors. Defaults to the main colorway used for trace colors. If you specify a new list here it can still be extended with lighter and darker colors, see extendfunnelareacolors.

funnelgap – Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of adjacent location coordinates.

funnelgroupgap – Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the same location coordinate.

funnelmode – Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are displayed on the graph. With “stack”, the bars are stacked on top of one another With “group”, the bars are plotted next to one another centered around the shared location. With “overlay”, the bars are plotted over one another, you might need to reduce “opacity” to see multiple bars.

geo – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Geo instance or dict with compatible properties

grid – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Grid instance or dict with compatible properties

height – Sets the plot’s height (in px).

hiddenlabels – hiddenlabels is the funnelarea & pie chart analog of visible:’legendonly’ but it can contain many labels, and can simultaneously hide slices from several pies/funnelarea charts

hiddenlabelssrc – Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for hiddenlabels.

hidesources – Determines whether or not a text link citing the data source is placed at the bottom-right cored of the figure. Has only an effect only on graphs that have been generated via forked graphs from the Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on- premise).

hoverdistance – Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data to add hover labels (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no looking for data). This is only a real distance for hovering on point-like objects, like scatter points. For area-like objects (bars, scatter fills, etc) hovering is on inside the area and off outside, but these objects will not supersede hover on point-like objects in case of conflict.

hoverlabel – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Hoverlabel instance or dict with compatible properties

hovermode – Determines the mode of hover interactions. If “closest”, a single hoverlabel will appear for the “closest” point within the hoverdistance. If “x” (or “y”), multiple hoverlabels will appear for multiple points at the “closest” x- (or y-) coordinate within the hoverdistance, with the caveat that no more than one hoverlabel will appear per trace. If x unified (or y unified), a single hoverlabel will appear multiple points at the closest x- (or y-) coordinate within the hoverdistance with the caveat that no more than one hoverlabel will appear per trace. In this mode, spikelines are enabled by default perpendicular to the specified axis. If false, hover interactions are disabled.

iciclecolorway – Sets the default icicle slice colors. Defaults to the main colorway used for trace colors. If you specify a new list here it can still be extended with lighter and darker colors, see extendiciclecolors.

mapbox – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Mapbox instance or dict with compatible properties

margin – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Margin instance or dict with compatible properties

meta – Assigns extra meta information that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as the graph, axis and colorbar title.text, annotation text trace.name in legend items, rangeselector, updatemenus and sliders label text all support meta. One can access meta fields using template strings: %{meta[i]} where i is the index of the meta item in question. meta can also be an object for example {key: value} which can be accessed %{meta[key]}.

metasrc – Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for meta.

minreducedheight – Minimum height of the plot with margin.automargin applied (in px)

minreducedwidth – Minimum width of the plot with margin.automargin applied (in px)

modebar – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Modebar instance or dict with compatible properties

newselection – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Newselection instance or dict with compatible properties

newshape – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Newshape instance or dict with compatible properties

paper_bgcolor – Sets the background color of the paper where the graph is drawn.

piecolorway – Sets the default pie slice colors. Defaults to the main colorway used for trace colors. If you specify a new list here it can still be extended with lighter and darker colors, see extendpiecolors.

plot_bgcolor – Sets the background color of the plotting area in- between x and y axes.

polar – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Polar instance or dict with compatible properties

scattergap – Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between scatter points of adjacent location coordinates. Defaults to bargap.

scattermode – Determines how scatter points at the same location coordinate are displayed on the graph. With “group”, the scatter points are plotted next to one another centered around the shared location. With “overlay”, the scatter points are plotted over one another, you might need to reduce “opacity” to see multiple scatter points.

scene – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Scene instance or dict with compatible properties

selectdirection – When dragmode is set to “select”, this limits the selection of the drag to horizontal, vertical or diagonal. “h” only allows horizontal selection, “v” only vertical, “d” only diagonal and “any” sets no limit.

selectionrevision – Controls persistence of user-driven changes in selected points from all traces.

selections – A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout.Selection instances or dicts with compatible properties

selectiondefaults – When used in a template (as layout.template.layout.selectiondefaults), sets the default property values to use for elements of layout.selections

separators – Sets the decimal and thousand separators. For example, *. * puts a ‘.’ before decimals and a space between thousands. In English locales, dflt is “.,” but other locales may alter this default.

shapes – A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout.Shape instances or dicts with compatible properties

shapedefaults – When used in a template (as layout.template.layout.shapedefaults), sets the default property values to use for elements of layout.shapes

showlegend – Determines whether or not a legend is drawn. Default is true if there is a trace to show and any of these: a) Two or more traces would by default be shown in the legend. b) One pie trace is shown in the legend. c) One trace is explicitly given with showlegend: true.

sliders – A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout.Slider instances or dicts with compatible properties

sliderdefaults – When used in a template (as layout.template.layout.sliderdefaults), sets the default property values to use for elements of layout.sliders

smith – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Smith instance or dict with compatible properties

spikedistance – Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data to draw spikelines to (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no looking for data). As with hoverdistance, distance does not apply to area-like objects. In addition, some objects can be hovered on but will not generate spikelines, such as scatter fills.

sunburstcolorway – Sets the default sunburst slice colors. Defaults to the main colorway used for trace colors. If you specify a new list here it can still be extended with lighter and darker colors, see extendsunburstcolors.

template – Default attributes to be applied to the plot. This should be a dict with format: {'layout': layoutTemplate, 'data': {trace_type: [traceTemplate, ...], ...}} where layoutTemplate is a dict matching the structure of figure.layout and traceTemplate is a dict matching the structure of the trace with type trace_type (e.g. ‘scatter’). Alternatively, this may be specified as an instance of plotly.graph_objects.layout.Template. Trace templates are applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container arrays (eg annotations) have special handling: An object ending in defaults (eg annotationdefaults) is applied to each array item. But if an item has a templateitemname key we look in the template array for an item with matching name and apply that instead. If no matching name is found we mark the item invisible. Any named template item not referenced is appended to the end of the array, so this can be used to add a watermark annotation or a logo image, for example. To omit one of these items on the plot, make an item with matching templateitemname and visible: false.

ternary – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Ternary instance or dict with compatible properties

title – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Title instance or dict with compatible properties

titlefont – Deprecated: Please use layout.title.font instead. Sets the title font. Note that the title’s font used to be customized by the now deprecated titlefont attribute.

transition – Sets transition options used during Plotly.react updates.

treemapcolorway – Sets the default treemap slice colors. Defaults to the main colorway used for trace colors. If you specify a new list here it can still be extended with lighter and darker colors, see extendtreemapcolors.

uirevision – Used to allow user interactions with the plot to persist after Plotly.react calls that are unaware of these interactions. If uirevision is omitted, or if it is given and it changed from the previous Plotly.react call, the exact new figure is used. If uirevision is truthy and did NOT change, any attribute that has been affected by user interactions and did not receive a different value in the new figure will keep the interaction value. layout.uirevision attribute serves as the default for uirevision attributes in various sub-containers. For finer control you can set these sub-attributes directly. For example, if your app separately controls the data on the x and y axes you might set xaxis.uirevision=*time* and yaxis.uirevision=*cost*. Then if only the y data is changed, you can update yaxis.uirevision=*quantity* and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range will retain any user-driven zoom.

uniformtext – plotly.graph_objects.layout.Uniformtext instance or dict with compatible properties

updatemenus – A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout.Updatemenu instances or dicts with compatible properties

updatemenudefaults – When used in a template (as layout.template.layout.updatemenudefaults), sets the default property values to use for elements of layout.updatemenus

violingap – Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces that have “width” set.

violingroupgap – Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of the same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that have “width” set.

violinmode – Determines how violins at the same location coordinate are displayed on the graph. If “group”, the violins are plotted next to one another centered around the shared location. If “overlay”, the violins are plotted over one another, you might need to set “opacity” to see them multiple violins. Has no effect on traces that have “width” set.

waterfallgap – Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of adjacent location coordinates.

waterfallgroupgap – Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the same location coordinate.

waterfallmode – Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are displayed on the graph. With “group”, the bars are plotted next to one another centered around the shared location. With “overlay”, the bars are plotted over one another, you might need to reduce “opacity” to see multiple bars.

width – Sets the plot’s width (in px).

Indicates in what coordinates the tail of the annotation (ax,ay) is specified. If set to a x axis id (e.g. “x” or “x2”), the x position refers to a x coordinate. If set to “paper”, the x position refers to the distance from the left of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by “domain” (separated by a space), the position behaves like for “paper”, but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the left of the domain of that axis: e.g., x2 domain refers to the domain of the second x axis and a x position of 0.5 refers to the point between the left and the right of the domain of the second x axis. In order for absolute positioning of the arrow to work, “axref” must be exactly the same as “xref”, otherwise “axref” will revert to “pixel” (explained next). For relative positioning, “axref” can be set to “pixel”, in which case the “ax” value is specified in pixels relative to “x”. Absolute positioning is useful for trendline annotations which should continue to indicate the correct trend when zoomed. Relative positioning is useful for specifying the text offset for an annotated point.

The ‘axref’ property is an enumeration that may be specified as:
One of the following enumeration values:
[‘pixel’]

A string that matches one of the following regular expressions:
[‘^x([2-9]|[1-9][0-9]+)?( domain)?$’]

Returns
Return type
Any

property ay
Sets the y component of the arrow tail about the arrow head. If ayref is pixel, a positive (negative) component corresponds to an arrow pointing from bottom to top (top to bottom). If ayref is not pixel and is exactly the same as yref, this is an absolute value on that axis, like y, specified in the same coordinates as yref.

The ‘ay’ property accepts values of any type

Returns
Return type
Any

property ayref
Indicates in what coordinates the tail of the annotation (ax,ay) is specified. If set to a y axis id (e.g. “y” or “y2”), the y position refers to a y coordinate. If set to “paper”, the y position refers to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by “domain” (separated by a space), the position behaves like for “paper”, but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the domain of that axis: e.g., y2 domain refers to the domain of the second y axis and a y position of 0.5 refers to the point between the bottom and the top of the domain of the second y axis. In order for absolute positioning of the arrow to work, “ayref” must be exactly the same as “yref”, otherwise “ayref” will revert to “pixel” (explained next). For relative positioning, “ayref” can be set to “pixel”, in which case the “ay” value is specified in pixels relative to “y”. Absolute positioning is useful for trendline annotations which should continue to indicate the correct trend when zoomed. Relative positioning is useful for specifying the text offset for an annotated point.

The ‘ayref’ property is an enumeration that may be specified as:
One of the following enumeration values:
[‘pixel’]

Determines whether the annotation text box captures mouse move and click events, or allows those events to pass through to data points in the plot that may be behind the annotation. By default captureevents is False unless hovertext is provided. If you use the event plotly_clickannotation without hovertext you must explicitly enable captureevents.

The ‘captureevents’ property must be specified as a bool (either True, or False)

Returns
Return type
bool

property clicktoshow
Makes this annotation respond to clicks on the plot. If you click a data point that exactly matches the x and y values of this annotation, and it is hidden (visible: false), it will appear. In “onoff” mode, you must click the same point again to make it disappear, so if you click multiple points, you can show multiple annotations. In “onout” mode, a click anywhere else in the plot (on another data point or not) will hide this annotation. If you need to show/hide this annotation in response to different x or y values, you can set xclick and/or yclick. This is useful for example to label the side of a bar. To label markers though, standoff is preferred over xclick and yclick.

The ‘clicktoshow’ property is an enumeration that may be specified as:
One of the following enumeration values:
[False, ‘onoff’, ‘onout’]

Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with templateitemname matching its name, alongside your modifications (including visible: false or enabled: false to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with visible: true.

The ‘templateitemname’ property is a string and must be specified as:
A string

A number that will be converted to a string

Returns
Return type
str

property text

An int or float in the interval [1, inf]

Returns
Return type
int|float

property x
Sets the annotation’s x position. If the axis type is “log”, then you must take the log of your desired range. If the axis type is “date”, it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis type is “category”, it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

The ‘x’ property accepts values of any type

Returns
Return type

property xanchor
Sets the text box’s horizontal position anchor This anchor binds the x position to the “left”, “center” or “right” of the annotation. For example, if x is set to 1, xref to “paper” and xanchor to “right” then the right-most portion of the annotation lines up with the right-most edge of the plotting area. If “auto”, the anchor is equivalent to “center” for data-referenced annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the closest side.

The ‘xanchor’ property is an enumeration that may be specified as:
One of the following enumeration values:
[‘auto’, ‘left’, ‘center’, ‘right’]

property xref
Sets the annotation’s x coordinate axis. If set to a x axis id (e.g. “x” or “x2”), the x position refers to a x coordinate. If set to “paper”, the x position refers to the distance from the left of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by “domain” (separated by a space), the position behaves like for “paper”, but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the left of the domain of that axis: e.g., x2 domain refers to the domain of the second x axis and a x position of 0.5 refers to the point between the left and the right of the domain of the second x axis.

The ‘y’ property accepts values of any type

Returns
Return type
Any

property yanchor
Sets the text box’s vertical position anchor This anchor binds the y position to the “top”, “middle” or “bottom” of the annotation. For example, if y is set to 1, yref to “paper” and yanchor to “top” then the top-most portion of the annotation lines up with the top-most edge of the plotting area. If “auto”, the anchor is equivalent to “middle” for data- referenced annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the closest side.

The ‘yanchor’ property is an enumeration that may be specified as:
One of the following enumeration values:

Returns
Return type
Any

property yref
Sets the annotation’s y coordinate axis. If set to a y axis id (e.g. “y” or “y2”), the y position refers to a y coordinate. If set to “paper”, the y position refers to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by “domain” (separated by a space), the position behaves like for “paper”, but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the domain of that axis: e.g., y2 domain refers to the domain of the second y axis and a y position of 0.5 refers to the point between the bottom and the top of the domain of the second y axis.

class plotly.graph_objects.layout.Coloraxis(arg=None, autocolorscale=None, cauto=None, cmax=None, cmid=None, cmin=None, colorbar=None, colorscale=None, reversescale=None, showscale=None, **kwargs)
property autocolorscale
Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (autocolorscale: true) or the palette determined by colorscale. In case colorscale is unspecified or autocolorscale is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the color array are all positive, all negative or mixed.

The ‘autocolorscale’ property must be specified as a bool (either True, or False)

Returns
Return type
bool

property cauto
Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here corresponding trace color array(s)) or the bounds set in cmin and cmax Defaults to false when cmin and cmax are set by the user.

The ‘cauto’ property must be specified as a bool (either True, or False)

Returns
Return type
bool

property cmax
Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as corresponding trace color array(s) and if set, cmin must be set as well.

The ‘cmax’ property is a number and may be specified as:
An int or float

Returns
Return type
int|float

property cmid

int|float

property colorbar
The ‘colorbar’ property is an instance of ColorBar that may be specified as:

An instance of plotly.graph_objects.layout.coloraxis.ColorBar

A dict of string/value properties that will be passed to the ColorBar constructor

Supported dict properties:

bgcolor
Sets the color of padded area.

bordercolor
Sets the axis line color.

borderwidth
Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar.

dtick
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with tick0. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to “log” and “date” axes. If the axis type is “log”, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, … set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, … set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, … set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. “log” has several special values; “L<f>”, where f is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example tick0 = 0.1, dtick = “L0.5” will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use “D1” (all digits) or “D2” (only 2 and 5). tick0 is ignored for “D1” and “D2”. If the axis type is “date”, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set dtick to 86400000.0. “date” also has special values “M<n>” gives ticks spaced by a number of months. n must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set tick0 to “2000-01-15” and dtick to “M3”. To set ticks every 4 years, set dtick to “M48”

exponentformat
Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If “none”, it appears as 1,000,000,000. If “e”, 1e+9. If “E”, 1E+9. If “power”, 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If “SI”, 1G. If “B”, 1B.

labelalias
Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For example using {US: ‘USA’, CA: ‘Canada’} changes US to USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown must match the keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1 instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired) can include html-like tags or MathJax.

len
Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends.

lenmode
Determines whether this color bar’s length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot “fraction” or in *pixels. Use len to set the value.

minexponent
Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when tickformat is “SI” or “B”.

nticks
Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to nticks. Has an effect only if tickmode is set to “auto”.

orientation
Sets the orientation of the colorbar.

outlinecolor
Sets the axis line color.

outlinewidth
Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.

separatethousands
If “true”, even 4-digit integers are separated

showexponent
If “all”, all exponents are shown besides their significands. If “first”, only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If “last”, only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If “none”, no exponents appear.

showticklabels
Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.

showtickprefix
If “all”, all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If “first”, only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If “last”, only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If “none”, tick prefixes are hidden.

showticksuffix
Same as showtickprefix but for tick suffixes.

thickness
Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels.

thicknessmode
Determines whether this color bar’s thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot “fraction” or in “pixels”. Use thickness to set the value.

tick0
Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with dtick. If the axis type is “log”, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the tick0 to 2) except when dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick for more info). If the axis type is “date”, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis type is “category”, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

tickangle
Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a tickangle of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.

tickcolor
Sets the tick color.

tickfont
Sets the color bar’s tick label font

tickformat
Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3- format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, 2016-10-13 09:15:23.456 with tickformat “%H~%M~%S.%2f” would display “09~15~23.46”

tickformatstops
A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout. coloraxis.colorbar.Tickformatstop instances or dicts with compatible properties

tickformatstopdefaults
When used in a template (as layout.template.lay out.coloraxis.colorbar.tickformatstopdefaults), sets the default property values to use for elements of layout.coloraxis.colorbar.tickformatstops

ticklabeloverflow
Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is hide past domain. In other cases the default is hide past div.

ticklabelposition
Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when orientation is “h”, top and bottom when orientation is “v”.

ticklabelstep
Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. tick0 determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with type “log” or “multicategory”, or when tickmode is “array”.

ticklen
Sets the tick length (in px).

tickmode
Sets the tick mode for this axis. If “auto”, the number of ticks is set via nticks. If “linear”, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position tick0 and a tick step dtick (“linear” is the default value if tick0 and dtick are provided).

property colorscale
Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, [[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use cmin and cmax. Alternatively, colorscale may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric, Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis, YlGnBu,YlOrRd.

The ‘colorscale’ property is a colorscale and may be specified as:

text
Sets the text to display with the new shape. It is also used for legend item if name is not provided.

textangle
Sets the angle at which the label text is drawn with respect to the horizontal. For lines, angle “auto” is the same angle as the line. For all other shapes, angle “auto” is horizontal.

textposition
Sets the position of the label text relative to the new shape. Supported values for rectangles, circles and paths are top left, top center, top right, middle left, middle center, middle right, bottom left, bottom center, and bottom right. Supported values for lines are “start”, “middle”, and “end”. Default: middle center for rectangles, circles, and paths; “middle” for lines.

texttemplate
Template string used for rendering the new shape’s label. Note that this will override text. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example “x0: %{x0}”. Numbers are formatted using d3-format’s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example “Price: %{x0:$.2f}”. See https://github.com/d3/d3- format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format’s syntax %{variable|d3-time- format}, for example “Day: %{x0|%m %b %Y}”. See https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. A single multiplication or division operation may be applied to numeric variables, and combined with d3 number formatting, for example “Length in cm: %{x0*2.54}”, “%{slope*60:.1f} meters per second.” For log axes, variable values are given in log units. For date axes, x/y coordinate variables and center variables use datetimes, while all other variable values use values in ms. Finally, the template string has access to variables x0, x1, y0, y1, slope, dx, dy, width, height, length, xcenter and ycenter.

xanchor
Sets the label’s horizontal position anchor This anchor binds the specified textposition to the “left”, “center” or “right” of the label text. For example, if textposition is set to top right and xanchor to “right” then the right-most portion of the label text lines up with the right-most edge of the new shape.

yanchor
Sets the label’s vertical position anchor This anchor binds the specified textposition to the “top”, “middle” or “bottom” of the label text. For example, if textposition is set to top right and yanchor to “top” then the top-most portion of the label text lines up with the top-most edge of the new shape.

An instance of plotly.graph_objects.layout.polar.AngularAxis

A dict of string/value properties that will be passed to the AngularAxis constructor

Supported dict properties:

autotypenumbers
Using “strict” a numeric string in trace data is not converted to a number. Using convert types a numeric string in trace data may be treated as a number during automatic axis type detection. Defaults to layout.autotypenumbers.

categoryarray
Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear. Only has an effect if categoryorder is set to “array”. Used with categoryorder.

categoryarraysrc
Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for categoryarray.

categoryorder
Specifies the ordering logic for the case of categorical variables. By default, plotly uses “trace”, which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set categoryorder to category ascending or category descending if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set categoryorder to “array” to derive the ordering from the attribute categoryarray. If a category is not found in the categoryarray array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the “trace” mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in categoryarray. Set categoryorder to total ascending or total descending if order should be determined by the numerical order of the values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values.

color
Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this.

direction
Sets the direction corresponding to positive angles.

dtick
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with tick0. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to “log” and “date” axes. If the axis type is “log”, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, … set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, … set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, … set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. “log” has several special values; “L<f>”, where f is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example tick0 = 0.1, dtick = “L0.5” will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use “D1” (all digits) or “D2” (only 2 and 5). tick0 is ignored for “D1” and “D2”. If the axis type is “date”, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set dtick to 86400000.0. “date” also has special values “M<n>” gives ticks spaced by a number of months. n must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set tick0 to “2000-01-15” and dtick to “M3”. To set ticks every 4 years, set dtick to “M48”

exponentformat
Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If “none”, it appears as 1,000,000,000. If “e”, 1e+9. If “E”, 1E+9. If “power”, 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If “SI”, 1G. If “B”, 1B.

gridcolor
Sets the color of the grid lines.

griddash
Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (“solid”, “dot”, “dash”, “longdash”, “dashdot”, or “longdashdot”) or a dash length list in px (eg “5px,10px,2px,2px”).

gridwidth
Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.

hoverformat
Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3- format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, 2016-10-13 09:15:23.456 with tickformat “%H~%M~%S.%2f” would display “09~15~23.46”

labelalias
Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For example using {US: ‘USA’, CA: ‘Canada’} changes US to USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown must match the keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1 instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired) can include html-like tags or MathJax.

layer
Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If above traces, this axis is displayed above all the subplot’s traces If below traces, this axis is displayed below all the subplot’s traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like traces with cliponaxis set to False to show markers and/or text nodes above this axis.

linecolor
Sets the axis line color.

linewidth
Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.

minexponent
Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when tickformat is “SI” or “B”.

nticks
Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to nticks. Has an effect only if tickmode is set to “auto”.

period
Set the angular period. Has an effect only when angularaxis.type is “category”.

rotation
Sets that start position (in degrees) of the angular axis By default, polar subplots with direction set to “counterclockwise” get a rotation of 0 which corresponds to due East (like what mathematicians prefer). In turn, polar with direction set to “clockwise” get a rotation of 90 which corresponds to due North (like on a compass),

separatethousands
If “true”, even 4-digit integers are separated

showexponent
If “all”, all exponents are shown besides their significands. If “first”, only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If “last”, only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If “none”, no exponents appear.

showgrid
Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.

showline
Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is drawn.

showticklabels
Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.

showtickprefix
If “all”, all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If “first”, only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If “last”, only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If “none”, tick prefixes are hidden.

showticksuffix
Same as showtickprefix but for tick suffixes.

thetaunit
Sets the format unit of the formatted “theta” values. Has an effect only when angularaxis.type is “linear”.

tick0
Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with dtick. If the axis type is “log”, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the tick0 to 2) except when dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick for more info). If the axis type is “date”, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis type is “category”, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

tickangle
Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a tickangle of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.

tickcolor
Sets the tick color.

tickfont

tickformat
Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3- format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, 2016-10-13 09:15:23.456 with tickformat “%H~%M~%S.%2f” would display “09~15~23.46”

tickformatstops
A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout. polar.angularaxis.Tickformatstop instances or dicts with compatible properties

tickformatstopdefaults
When used in a template (as layout.template.lay out.polar.angularaxis.tickformatstopdefaults), sets the default property values to use for elements of layout.polar.angularaxis.tickformatstops

ticklabelstep
Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. tick0 determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with type “log” or “multicategory”, or when tickmode is “array”.

ticklen
Sets the tick length (in px).

tickmode
Sets the tick mode for this axis. If “auto”, the number of ticks is set via nticks. If “linear”, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position tick0 and a tick step dtick (“linear” is the default value if tick0 and dtick are provided). If “array”, the placement of the ticks is set via tickvals and the tick text is ticktext. (“array” is the default value if tickvals is provided).

Sets the vertical domain of this polar subplot (in plot fraction).

Returns
Return type
plotly.graph_objects.layout.polar.Domain

property gridshape
Determines if the radial axis grid lines and angular axis line are drawn as “circular” sectors or as “linear” (polygon) sectors. Has an effect only when the angular axis has type “category”. Note that radialaxis.angle is snapped to the angle of the closest vertex when gridshape is “circular” (so that radial axis scale is the same as the data scale).

The ‘gridshape’ property is an enumeration that may be specified as:
One of the following enumeration values:
[‘circular’, ‘linear’]

Returns
Return type
Any

property hole
Sets the fraction of the radius to cut out of the polar subplot.

The ‘hole’ property is a number and may be specified as:
An int or float in the interval [0, 1]

Returns
Return type
int|float

property radialaxis
The ‘radialaxis’ property is an instance of RadialAxis that may be specified as:

An instance of plotly.graph_objects.layout.polar.RadialAxis

A dict of string/value properties that will be passed to the RadialAxis constructor

Supported dict properties:

angle
Sets the angle (in degrees) from which the radial axis is drawn. Note that by default, radial axis line on the theta=0 line corresponds to a line pointing right (like what mathematicians prefer). Defaults to the first polar.sector angle.

autorange
Determines whether or not the range of this axis is computed in relation to the input data. See rangemode for more info. If range is provided, then autorange is set to False.

autotypenumbers
Using “strict” a numeric string in trace data is not converted to a number. Using convert types a numeric string in trace data may be treated as a number during automatic axis type detection. Defaults to layout.autotypenumbers.

calendar
Sets the calendar system to use for range and tick0 if this is a date axis. This does not set the calendar for interpreting data on this axis, that’s specified in the trace or via the global layout.calendar

categoryarray
Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear. Only has an effect if categoryorder is set to “array”. Used with categoryorder.

categoryarraysrc
Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for categoryarray.

categoryorder
Specifies the ordering logic for the case of categorical variables. By default, plotly uses “trace”, which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set categoryorder to category ascending or category descending if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set categoryorder to “array” to derive the ordering from the attribute categoryarray. If a category is not found in the categoryarray array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the “trace” mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in categoryarray. Set categoryorder to total ascending or total descending if order should be determined by the numerical order of the values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values.

color
Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this.

dtick
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with tick0. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to “log” and “date” axes. If the axis type is “log”, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, … set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, … set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, … set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. “log” has several special values; “L<f>”, where f is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example tick0 = 0.1, dtick = “L0.5” will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use “D1” (all digits) or “D2” (only 2 and 5). tick0 is ignored for “D1” and “D2”. If the axis type is “date”, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set dtick to 86400000.0. “date” also has special values “M<n>” gives ticks spaced by a number of months. n must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set tick0 to “2000-01-15” and dtick to “M3”. To set ticks every 4 years, set dtick to “M48”

exponentformat
Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If “none”, it appears as 1,000,000,000. If “e”, 1e+9. If “E”, 1E+9. If “power”, 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If “SI”, 1G. If “B”, 1B.

gridcolor
Sets the color of the grid lines.

griddash
Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (“solid”, “dot”, “dash”, “longdash”, “dashdot”, or “longdashdot”) or a dash length list in px (eg “5px,10px,2px,2px”).

gridwidth
Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.

hoverformat
Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3- format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, 2016-10-13 09:15:23.456 with tickformat “%H~%M~%S.%2f” would display “09~15~23.46”

labelalias
Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For example using {US: ‘USA’, CA: ‘Canada’} changes US to USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown must match the keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1 instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired) can include html-like tags or MathJax.

layer
Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If above traces, this axis is displayed above all the subplot’s traces If below traces, this axis is displayed below all the subplot’s traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like traces with cliponaxis set to False to show markers and/or text nodes above this axis.

linecolor
Sets the axis line color.

linewidth
Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.

minexponent
Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when tickformat is “SI” or “B”.

nticks
Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to nticks. Has an effect only if tickmode is set to “auto”.

range
Sets the range of this axis. If the axis type is “log”, then you must take the log of your desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis type is “date”, it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis type is “category”, it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

rangemode
If *tozero*`, the range extends to 0, regardless of the input data If “nonnegative”, the range is non-negative, regardless of the input data. If “normal”, the range is computed in relation to the extrema of the input data (same behavior as for cartesian axes).

separatethousands
If “true”, even 4-digit integers are separated

showexponent
If “all”, all exponents are shown besides their significands. If “first”, only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If “last”, only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If “none”, no exponents appear.

showgrid

showline
Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is drawn.

showticklabels
Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.

showtickprefix
If “all”, all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If “first”, only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If “last”, only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If “none”, tick prefixes are hidden.

showticksuffix
Same as showtickprefix but for tick suffixes.

side
Determines on which side of radial axis line the tick and tick labels appear.

tick0
Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with dtick. If the axis type is “log”, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the tick0 to 2) except when dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick for more info). If the axis type is “date”, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis type is “category”, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

tickangle
Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a tickangle of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.

tickcolor
Sets the tick color.

tickfont
Sets the tick font.

tickformat
Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3- format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits.

hoverlabel
plotly.graph_objects.layout.scene.annot ation.Hoverlabel instance or dict with compatible properties

hovertext
Sets text to appear when hovering over this annotation. If omitted or blank, no hover label will appear.

name
When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with templateitemname matching this name alongside your modifications (including visible: false or enabled: false to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template.

opacity
Sets the opacity of the annotation (text + arrow).

showarrow
Determines whether or not the annotation is drawn with an arrow. If True, text is placed near the arrow’s tail. If False, text lines up with the x and y provided.

standoff
Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the end arrowhead away from the position it is pointing at, for example to point at the edge of a marker independent of zoom. Note that this shortens the arrow from the ax / ay vector, in contrast to xshift / yshift which moves everything by this amount.

startarrowhead
Sets the start annotation arrow head style.

startarrowsize
Sets the size of the start annotation arrow head, relative to arrowwidth. A value of 1 (default) gives a head about 3x as wide as the line.

startstandoff
Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the start arrowhead away from the position it is pointing at, for example to point at the edge of a marker independent of zoom. Note that this shortens the arrow from the ax / ay vector, in contrast to xshift / yshift which moves everything by this amount.

templateitemname
Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with templateitemname matching its name, alongside your modifications (including visible: false or enabled: false to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with visible: true.

text
Sets the text associated with this annotation. Plotly uses a subset of HTML tags to do things like newline (<br>), bold (<b></b>), italics (<i></i>), hyperlinks (<a href=’…’></a>). Tags <em>, <sup>, <sub> <span> are also supported.

textangle

valign
Sets the vertical alignment of the text within the box. Has an effect only if an explicit height is set to override the text height.

visible
Determines whether or not this annotation is visible.

width
Sets an explicit width for the text box. null (default) lets the text set the box width. Wider text will be clipped. There is no automatic wrapping; use <br> to start a new line.

x
Sets the annotation’s x position.

xanchor
Sets the text box’s horizontal position anchor This anchor binds the x position to the “left”, “center” or “right” of the annotation. For example, if x is set to 1, xref to “paper” and xanchor to “right” then the right-most portion of the annotation lines up with the right-most edge of the plotting area. If “auto”, the anchor is equivalent to “center” for data-referenced annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the closest side.

xshift
Shifts the position of the whole annotation and arrow to the right (positive) or left (negative) by this many pixels.

y
Sets the annotation’s y position.

yanchor
Sets the text box’s vertical position anchor This anchor binds the y position to the “top”, “middle” or “bottom” of the annotation. For example, if y is set to 1, yref to “paper” and yanchor to “top” then the top- most portion of the annotation lines up with the top-most edge of the plotting area. If “auto”, the anchor is equivalent to “middle” for data-referenced annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the closest side.

yshift
Shifts the position of the whole annotation and arrow up (positive) or down (negative) by this many pixels.

z
Sets the annotation’s z position.

An instance of plotly.graph_objects.layout.scene.XAxis

A dict of string/value properties that will be passed to the XAxis constructor

Supported dict properties:

autorange
Determines whether or not the range of this axis is computed in relation to the input data. See rangemode for more info. If range is provided, then autorange is set to False.

autotypenumbers
Using “strict” a numeric string in trace data is not converted to a number. Using convert types a numeric string in trace data may be treated as a number during automatic axis type detection. Defaults to layout.autotypenumbers.

backgroundcolor
Sets the background color of this axis’ wall.

calendar
Sets the calendar system to use for range and tick0 if this is a date axis. This does not set the calendar for interpreting data on this axis, that’s specified in the trace or via the global layout.calendar

categoryarray
Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear. Only has an effect if categoryorder is set to “array”. Used with categoryorder.

categoryarraysrc
Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for categoryarray.

categoryorder
Specifies the ordering logic for the case of categorical variables. By default, plotly uses “trace”, which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set categoryorder to category ascending or category descending if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set categoryorder to “array” to derive the ordering from the attribute categoryarray. If a category is not found in the categoryarray array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the “trace” mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in categoryarray. Set categoryorder to total ascending or total descending if order should be determined by the numerical order of the values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values.

color
Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this.

dtick
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with tick0. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to “log” and “date” axes. If the axis type is “log”, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, … set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, … set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, … set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. “log” has several special values; “L<f>”, where f is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example tick0 = 0.1, dtick = “L0.5” will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use “D1” (all digits) or “D2” (only 2 and 5). tick0 is ignored for “D1” and “D2”. If the axis type is “date”, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set dtick to 86400000.0. “date” also has special values “M<n>” gives ticks spaced by a number of months. n must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set tick0 to “2000-01-15” and dtick to “M3”. To set ticks every 4 years, set dtick to “M48”

exponentformat
Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If “none”, it appears as 1,000,000,000. If “e”, 1e+9. If “E”, 1E+9. If “power”, 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If “SI”, 1G. If “B”, 1B.

gridcolor
Sets the color of the grid lines.

gridwidth
Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.

hoverformat
Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3- format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, 2016-10-13 09:15:23.456 with tickformat “%H~%M~%S.%2f” would display “09~15~23.46”

labelalias
Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For example using {US: ‘USA’, CA: ‘Canada’} changes US to USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown must match the keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1 instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired) can include html-like tags or MathJax.

linecolor
Sets the axis line color.

linewidth
Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.

minexponent
Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when tickformat is “SI” or “B”.

mirror
Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the axis lines are mirrored. If “ticks”, the axis lines and ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If “all”, axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots. If “allticks”, axis lines and ticks are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.

nticks
Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to nticks. Has an effect only if tickmode is set to “auto”.

range
Sets the range of this axis. If the axis type is “log”, then you must take the log of your desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis type is “date”, it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis type is “category”, it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

rangemode
If “normal”, the range is computed in relation to the extrema of the input data. If *tozero*`, the range extends to 0, regardless of the input data If “nonnegative”, the range is non- negative, regardless of the input data. Applies only to linear axes.

separatethousands
If “true”, even 4-digit integers are separated

tick0
Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with dtick. If the axis type is “log”, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the tick0 to 2) except when dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick for more info). If the axis type is “date”, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis type is “category”, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

tickangle
Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a tickangle of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.

tickcolor
Sets the tick color.

tickfont

To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, … set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. “log” has several special values; “L<f>”, where f is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example tick0 = 0.1, dtick = “L0.5” will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use “D1” (all digits) or “D2” (only 2 and 5). tick0 is ignored for “D1” and “D2”. If the axis type is “date”, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set dtick to 86400000.0. “date” also has special values “M<n>” gives ticks spaced by a number of months. n must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set tick0 to “2000-01-15” and dtick to “M3”. To set ticks every 4 years, set dtick to “M48”

exponentformat
Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If “none”, it appears as 1,000,000,000. If “e”, 1e+9. If “E”, 1E+9. If “power”, 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If “SI”, 1G. If “B”, 1B.

gridcolor
Sets the color of the grid lines.

gridwidth
Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.

hoverformat
Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3- format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, 2016-10-13 09:15:23.456 with tickformat “%H~%M~%S.%2f” would display “09~15~23.46”

labelalias
Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For example using {US: ‘USA’, CA: ‘Canada’} changes US to USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown must match the keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1 instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired) can include html-like tags or MathJax.

linecolor
Sets the axis line color.

linewidth
Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.

minexponent
Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when tickformat is “SI” or “B”.

mirror
Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the axis lines are mirrored. If “ticks”, the axis lines and ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If “all”, axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots. If “allticks”, axis lines and ticks are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.

nticks
Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to nticks. Has an effect only if tickmode is set to “auto”.

range
Sets the range of this axis. If the axis type is “log”, then you must take the log of your desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis type is “date”, it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis type is “category”, it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

rangemode
If “normal”, the range is computed in relation to the extrema of the input data. If *tozero*`, the range extends to 0, regardless of the input data If “nonnegative”, the range is non- negative, regardless of the input data. Applies only to linear axes.

separatethousands

showticklabels
Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.

showtickprefix
If “all”, all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If “first”, only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If “last”, only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If “none”, tick prefixes are hidden.

showticksuffix
Same as showtickprefix but for tick suffixes.

spikecolor
Sets the color of the spikes.

spikesides
Sets whether or not spikes extending from the projection data points to this axis’ wall boundaries are shown on hover.

spikethickness
Sets the thickness (in px) of the spikes.

tick0
Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with dtick. If the axis type is “log”, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the tick0 to 2) except when dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick for more info). If the axis type is “date”, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis type is “category”, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

tickangle
Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a tickangle of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.

tickcolor
Sets the tick color.

tickfont
Sets the tick font.

tickformat
Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3- format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, 2016-10-13 09:15:23.456 with tickformat “%H~%M~%S.%2f” would display “09~15~23.46”

ticklen
Sets the tick length (in px).

tickmode
Sets the tick mode for this axis. If “auto”, the number of ticks is set via nticks. If “linear”, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position tick0 and a tick step dtick (“linear” is the default value if tick0 and dtick are provided). If “array”, the placement of the ticks is set via tickvals and the tick text is ticktext. (“array” is the default value if tickvals is provided).

tickprefix
Sets a tick label prefix.

ticks
Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If “”, this axis’ ticks are not drawn. If “outside” (“inside”), this axis’ are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.

ticksuffix

type
Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to determined the axis type by looking into the data of the traces that referenced the axis in question.

visible
A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving interaction like dragging. Default is true when a cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false

zeroline
Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the 0 value of this axis. If True, the zero line is drawn on top of the grid lines.

Supported values for rectangles, circles and paths are top left, top center, top right, middle left, middle center, middle right, bottom left, bottom center, and bottom right. Supported values for lines are “start”, “middle”, and “end”. Default: middle center for rectangles, circles, and paths; “middle” for lines.

texttemplate
Template string used for rendering the shape’s label. Note that this will override text. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example “x0: %{x0}”. Numbers are formatted using d3-format’s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example “Price: %{x0:$.2f}”. See https://gi thub.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format’s syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example “Day: %{x0|%m %b %Y}”. See https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. A single multiplication or division operation may be applied to numeric variables, and combined with d3 number formatting, for example “Length in cm: %{x0*2.54}”, “%{slope*60:.1f} meters per second.” For log axes, variable values are given in log units. For date axes, x/y coordinate variables and center variables use datetimes, while all other variable values use values in ms. Finally, the template string has access to variables x0, x1, y0, y1, slope, dx, dy, width, height, length, xcenter and ycenter.

xanchor
Sets the label’s horizontal position anchor This anchor binds the specified textposition to the “left”, “center” or “right” of the label text. For example, if textposition is set to top right and xanchor to “right” then the right-most portion of the label text lines up with the right-most edge of the shape.

yanchor
Sets the label’s vertical position anchor This anchor binds the specified textposition to the “top”, “middle” or “bottom” of the label text. For example, if textposition is set to top right and yanchor to “top” then the top-most portion of the label text lines up with the top-most edge of the shape.

property path
For type “path” - a valid SVG path with the pixel values replaced by data values in xsizemode/ysizemode being “scaled” and taken unmodified as pixels relative to xanchor and yanchor in case of “pixel” size mode. There are a few restrictions / quirks only absolute instructions, not relative. So the allowed segments are: M, L, H, V, Q, C, T, S, and Z arcs (A) are not allowed because radius rx and ry are relative. In the future we could consider supporting relative commands, but we would have to decide on how to handle date and log axes. Note that even as is, Q and C Bezier paths that are smooth on linear axes may not be smooth on log, and vice versa. no chained “polybezier” commands - specify the segment type for each one. On category axes, values are numbers scaled to the serial numbers of categories because using the categories themselves there would be no way to describe fractional positions On data axes: because space and T are both normal components of path strings, we can’t use either to separate date from time parts. Therefore we’ll use underscore for this purpose: 2015-02-21_13:45:56.789

If set to “pixel”, xanchor specifies the x position in terms of data or plot fraction but x0, x1 and x coordinates within path are pixels relative to xanchor. This way, the shape can have a fixed width while maintaining a position relative to data or plot fraction.

The ‘xsizemode’ property is an enumeration that may be specified as:
One of the following enumeration values:
[‘scaled’, ‘pixel’]

Returns
Return type
Any

property y0
Sets the shape’s starting y position. See type and ysizemode for more info.

The ‘y0’ property accepts values of any type

Returns
Return type
Any

property y1
Sets the shape’s end y position. See type and ysizemode for more info.

The ‘y1’ property accepts values of any type

Returns
Return type
Any

property yanchor
Only relevant in conjunction with ysizemode set to “pixel”. Specifies the anchor point on the y axis to which y0, y1 and y coordinates within path are relative to. E.g. useful to attach a pixel sized shape to a certain data value. No effect when ysizemode not set to “pixel”.

The ‘yanchor’ property accepts values of any type

Returns
Return type
Any

property yref
Sets the shape’s y coordinate axis. If set to a y axis id (e.g. “y” or “y2”), the y position refers to a y coordinate. If set to “paper”, the y position refers to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by “domain” (separated by a space), the position behaves like for “paper”, but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the domain of that axis: e.g., y2 domain refers to the domain of the second y axis and a y position of 0.5 refers to the point between the bottom and the top of the domain of the second y axis.

The ‘yref’ property is an enumeration that may be specified as:
One of the following enumeration values:
[‘paper’]

[‘^y([2-9]|[1-9][0-9]+)?( domain)?$’]

Returns
Return type
Any

property ysizemode
Sets the shapes’s sizing mode along the y axis. If set to “scaled”, y0, y1 and y coordinates within path refer to data values on the y axis or a fraction of the plot area’s height (yref set to “paper”). If set to “pixel”, yanchor specifies the y position in terms of data or plot fraction but y0, y1 and y coordinates within path are pixels relative to yanchor. This way, the shape can have a fixed height while maintaining a position relative to data or plot fraction.

The ‘ysizemode’ property is an enumeration that may be specified as:
One of the following enumeration values:
[‘scaled’, ‘pixel’]

Returns
Return type

labelalias
Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For example using {US: ‘USA’, CA: ‘Canada’} changes US to USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown must match the keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1 instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired) can include html-like tags or MathJax.

showticksuffix
Same as showtickprefix but for tick suffixes.

tickcolor
Sets the tick color.

tickfont
Sets the tick font.

tickformat
Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3- format.

We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, 2016-10-13 09:15:23.456 with tickformat “%H~%M~%S.%2f” would display “09~15~23.46”

labelalias
Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For example using {US: ‘USA’, CA: ‘Canada’} changes US to USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown must match the keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1 instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired) can include html-like tags or MathJax.

The ‘aaxis’ property is an instance of Aaxis that may be specified as:

An instance of plotly.graph_objects.layout.ternary.Aaxis

A dict of string/value properties that will be passed to the Aaxis constructor

Supported dict properties:

color
Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this.

dtick
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with tick0. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to “log” and “date” axes. If the axis type is “log”, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, … set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, … set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, … set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. “log” has several special values; “L<f>”, where f is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example tick0 = 0.1, dtick = “L0.5” will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use “D1” (all digits) or “D2” (only 2 and 5). tick0 is ignored for “D1” and “D2”. If the axis type is “date”, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set dtick to 86400000.0. “date” also has special values “M<n>” gives ticks spaced by a number of months. n must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set tick0 to “2000-01-15” and dtick to “M3”. To set ticks every 4 years, set dtick to “M48”

exponentformat
Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If “none”, it appears as 1,000,000,000. If “e”, 1e+9. If “E”, 1E+9. If “power”, 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If “SI”, 1G. If “B”, 1B.

gridcolor
Sets the color of the grid lines.

griddash
Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (“solid”, “dot”, “dash”, “longdash”, “dashdot”, or “longdashdot”) or a dash length list in px (eg “5px,10px,2px,2px”).

gridwidth
Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.

And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, 2016-10-13 09:15:23.456 with tickformat “%H~%M~%S.%2f” would display “09~15~23.46”

If the axis type is “date”, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis type is “category”, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

tickangle
Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a tickangle of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.

tickcolor
Sets the tick color.

tickfont
Sets the tick font.

ticklen
Sets the tick length (in px).

tickmode
Sets the tick mode for this axis. If “auto”, the number of ticks is set via nticks. If “linear”, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position tick0 and a tick step dtick (“linear” is the default value if tick0 and dtick are provided). If “array”, the placement of the ticks is set via tickvals and the tick text is ticktext. (“array” is the default value if tickvals is provided).

Returns
Return type
str

property caxis
The ‘caxis’ property is an instance of Caxis that may be specified as:

An instance of plotly.graph_objects.layout.ternary.Caxis

A dict of string/value properties that will be passed to the Caxis constructor

Supported dict properties:

color
Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this.

dtick
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with tick0. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to “log” and “date” axes. If the axis type is “log”, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, … set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, … set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, … set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. “log” has several special values; “L<f>”, where f is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example tick0 = 0.1, dtick = “L0.5” will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use “D1” (all digits) or “D2” (only 2 and 5). tick0 is ignored for “D1” and “D2”. If the axis type is “date”, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set dtick to 86400000.0. “date” also has special values “M<n>” gives ticks spaced by a number of months. n must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set tick0 to “2000-01-15” and dtick to “M3”. To set ticks every 4 years, set dtick to “M48”

exponentformat
Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If “none”, it appears as 1,000,000,000. If “e”, 1e+9. If “E”, 1E+9. If “power”, 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If “SI”, 1G. If “B”, 1B.

gridcolor
Sets the color of the grid lines.

griddash
Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (“solid”, “dot”, “dash”, “longdash”, “dashdot”, or “longdashdot”) or a dash length list in px (eg “5px,10px,2px,2px”).

gridwidth
Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.

hoverformat
Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3- format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, 2016-10-13 09:15:23.456 with tickformat “%H~%M~%S.%2f” would display “09~15~23.46”

labelalias
Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For example using {US: ‘USA’, CA: ‘Canada’} changes US to USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown must match the keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1 instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired) can include html-like tags or MathJax.

layer
Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If above traces, this axis is displayed above all the subplot’s traces If below traces, this axis is displayed below all the subplot’s traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like traces with cliponaxis set to False to show markers and/or text nodes above this axis.

linecolor
Sets the axis line color.

linewidth
Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.

min
The minimum value visible on this axis. The maximum is determined by the sum minus the minimum values of the other two axes. The full view corresponds to all the minima set to zero.

minexponent
Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when tickformat is “SI” or “B”.

nticks
Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to nticks. Has an effect only if tickmode is set to “auto”.

separatethousands
If “true”, even 4-digit integers are separated

showexponent
If “all”, all exponents are shown besides their significands. If “first”, only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If “last”, only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If “none”, no exponents appear.

showgrid
Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.

showline
Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is drawn.

showticklabels
Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.

showtickprefix
If “all”, all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If “first”, only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If “last”, only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If “none”, tick prefixes are hidden.

showticksuffix
Same as showtickprefix but for tick suffixes.

tick0
Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with dtick. If the axis type is “log”, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the tick0 to 2) except when dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick for more info). If the axis type is “date”, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis type is “category”, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

tickangle
Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a tickangle of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.

tickcolor
Sets the tick color.

tickfont
Sets the tick font.

tickformat
Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3- format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time- format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3’s date formatter: “%h” for half of the year as a decimal number as well as “%{n}f” for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, 2016-10-13 09:15:23.456 with tickformat “%H~%M~%S.%2f” would display “09~15~23.46”

A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout. ternary.caxis.Tickformatstop instances or dicts with compatible properties

tickformatstopdefaults
When used in a template (as layout.template.lay out.ternary.caxis.tickformatstopdefaults), sets the default property values to use for elements of layout.ternary.caxis.tickformatstops

ticklabelstep
Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. tick0 determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with type “log” or “multicategory”, or when tickmode is “array”.

ticklen
Sets the tick length (in px).

tickmode
Sets the tick mode for this axis. If “auto”, the number of ticks is set via nticks. If “linear”, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position tick0 and a tick step dtick (“linear” is the default value if tick0 and dtick are provided). If “array”, the placement of the ticks is set via tickvals and the tick text is ticktext. (“array” is the default value if tickvals is provided).

tickprefix
Sets a tick label prefix.

ticks
Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If “”, this axis’ ticks are not drawn. If “outside” (“inside”), this axis’ are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.

ticksuffix
Sets a tick label suffix.

ticktext
Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via tickvals. Only has an effect if tickmode is set to “array”. Used with tickvals.

ticktextsrc
Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for ticktext.

tickvals
Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if tickmode is set to “array”. Used with ticktext.

method
Sets the Plotly method to be called on click. If the skip method is used, the API updatemenu will function as normal but will perform no API calls and will not bind automatically to state updates. This may be used to create a component interface and attach to updatemenu events manually via JavaScript.

name
When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array.

You can chain these, ie yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*} but you can only link axes of the same type. The linked axis can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across subplots). Loops (yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis: {scaleanchor: *y*} or longer) are redundant and the last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid possible inconsistent constraints via scaleratio.

You can chain these, ie yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*} but you can only link axes of the same type. The linked axis can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across subplots). Loops (yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis: {scaleanchor: *y*} or longer) are redundant and the last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid possible inconsistent constraints via scaleratio.

Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren’t available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include “Arial”, “Balto”, “Courier New”, “Droid Sans”,, “Droid Serif”, “Droid Sans Mono”, “Gravitas One”, “Old Standard TT”, “Open Sans”, “Overpass”, “PT Sans Narrow”, “Raleway”, “Times New Roman”.
