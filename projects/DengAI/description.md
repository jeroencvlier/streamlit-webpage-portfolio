Utilizing environmental datasets provided by U.S. Federal Government agencies, this initiative seeks to delve deeper into the relationship between meteorological changes and the spread of Dengue fever. The data ranges from humidity shifts to vegetation alterations, is a goldmine for epidemiological study.

Our methodological approach focuses on harnessing statistical and machine learning techniques. By developing predictive algorithms, we aim to gauge the weekly trajectory of Dengue cases in two distinct geographical areas: San Juan and Iquitos. These locations, while separated by miles, share alarming spikes in Dengue incidence, making them pivotal study points.

Success in this project offers more than just numbers. Accurate predictions mean timely interventions, empowering local health authorities with the foresight needed for impactful preventive measures. Furthermore, it paves the way for similar studies on other diseases, broadening the scope of climate-health research.
