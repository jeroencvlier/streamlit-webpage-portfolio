### Introduction

<div class='StyledHR StyledHRProjects'></div>

As our climate continues to change, the proliferation of infectious diseases grows increasingly concerning. The transmission of diseases such as Dengue fever is intricately linked to climate variables. By studying the connection between climate and Dengue dynamics, we can optimize resource allocation, enhancing our ability to combat potential pandemics.

In this project, we will be using environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies to predict the number of Dengue fever cases reported each week in two specific locations: San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Iquitos, Peru. From this study we hope to gain a better understanding of how climate variables impact the spread of the disease, and how we can use this information to forecast the spread of Dengue fever.
