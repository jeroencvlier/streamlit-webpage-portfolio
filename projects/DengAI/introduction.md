**Objective**: Utilizing environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies, this project aims to predict the number of Dengue fever cases reported each week in two specific locations: San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Iquitos, Peru.

**Background**: Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease found in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Its transmission dynamics are related to climate variables like temperature and precipitation. Understanding the relationship between climate and Dengue dynamics can lead to better resource allocation to fight pandemics.
