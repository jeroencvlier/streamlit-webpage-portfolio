### Description


The primary objective of this project is to construct a fully functional web application utilizing the Streamlit library within Python. Specifically designed to serve as a digital resume, this app showcases various Data Science projects in an engaging and interactive manner. By blending creativity with functionality, the application provides a unique platform to exhibit my skills, creativity, and passion for Data Science.

Deployed on [render.com](https://www.render.com), the application is readily accessible to users interested in exploring my work. For those who wish to delve into the code and explore the technical intricacies, the [GitHub repository is available at the following link](https://www.github.com/jeroencvlier/streamlit-webpage-portfolio). Feel free to explore, share feedback, or even contribute to this dynamic and evolving project!
