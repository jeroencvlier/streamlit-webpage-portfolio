## About Me

<div class='StyledHR StyledHRProjects'></div>

Born in South Africa, I hold dual nationality with the Netherlands. My academic and professional journey has been a global and diverse adventure taking me through many cultures and landscapes including those of South Africa, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. I am passionate about the outdoors and exploring comes second nature to me.

I have a background in Geology and have worked in the mining industry for 4 years. Leveraging my background in geology, I've pivoted to data science, infusing my work with a unique perspective in problem-solving and analysis.
