## About Me

<div class='StyledHR StyledHRProjects'></div>

South African born with Dutch and South African nationality. I have studied and worked in South Africa, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. I am very passionate
about the outdoors and love to travel. 

I have a background in Geology and have worked in the mining industry for 4 years. 
Leveraging my background in geology, I've pivoted to data science, infusing my 
work with a unique perspective in problem-solving and analysis.
