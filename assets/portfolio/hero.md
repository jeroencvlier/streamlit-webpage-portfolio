A dynamic and dedicated data scientist 
with over 3 years of hands-on experience, 
I have designed, deployed, and refined a 
diverse range of machine learning and 
reinforcement learning models, specializing 
in Python. Leveraging my 7-year 
background in geology, I've pivoted my 
technical and analytical skills to data 
science, bringing a unique perspective to 
problem-solving and analysis. I am passionate 
about learning and committed to staying 
informed about emerging technologies.
