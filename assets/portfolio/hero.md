Hello! I'm Jeroen. 

I have been working professionally as a Data Scientist since 2020, 
building machine learning models and data pipelines 
for various use cases. These range from developing 
trade signals using reinforcement learning in the 
stock market to transactional fraud detection on FinTech platforms.

If you would like to send me a message, explore my projects,
or book some time, please explore the links.
