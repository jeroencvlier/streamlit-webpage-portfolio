Hello! I'm Jeroen. I have been working professionally as a Data Scientist since 2020, 
building machine learning models and data pipelines 
for various use cases. These range from developing 
trade signals using reinforcement learning in the 
stock market to transactional fraud detection on FinTech platforms.

Leveraging my 7-year background in geology, I've 
pivoted to data science, infusing my work with a 
unique perspective in problem-solving and analysis.
